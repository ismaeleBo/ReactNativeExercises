## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Blood Type API

- Call the API that provides anonymous blood type information for users: [Blood Type API](https://random-data-api.com/api/v2/blood_types?size=50)
- Display a summary showing the total number of items divided by type and rh_factor.
- Show a sorted list, ordered by id, of the different objects returned by the service.
- Each list item should display id and blood type.
- Implement radio buttons for filtering the list by type and rh_factor.

### Exercise 2: Stripe API

- Call the API: [Stripe API](https://random-data-api.com/api/stripe/random_stripe?size=50)
- Display a list of cards that will expire in the next 18 months.
- Each list item should display a valid card number and expiration date.
- Sort the items by expiration date, starting with the ones expiring soonest.

### Exercise 3: Xmas Tree Page

Create a page structured as follows:

- Text input that accepts an integer (as seen in the example image, it's 18).
- A button that, when tapped, creates the rotated (90Â°) Xmas tree figure. The integer indicates the height of the triangle.
- The base of the tree should be one-sixth of the triangle's height.
